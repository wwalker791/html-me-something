                    <p>There are 14 types of weapons in the world of Monster Hunter. From the quick and
                        agile sword &amp; shield, to the long ranged bow,to the sluggish but immensely powerful
                        great sword. You can go into training mode to give all of them a try and find 
                        one that suits your preferred playstyle.

                    <p>Every monster is different; each with their own weak points, attack patterns and ailments
                        they can inflict. Against a venomous monster, make sure you have plenty of antidotes. If
                        facing a nimble foe, try setting a trap to keep them in place long enought to strike. Being
                        aware of what you're up against can be the difference between victory and defeat.</p>
